        <p>I grew up in Ohio and still live there. I currently work full-time at a clinic but am continuing my education
            through online studies on BYU pathway. Right now, I am studying software development and have been fasinated by all the things I have learned. I enjoy all kinds of activities from reading, to hiking, to games, and 
            more. I served my mission in Anaheim, California for one year right when covid-19 began. I spent the second year 
            of my mission in Mexico City West Mission. I currently am a primary teacher in our local ward and love my calling. </p>

        <p>Ohio is in the northeastern area of the United States just below Lake Erie. It is one of the most industrious and populated states in the country with almost 12 million citizens. It leads in agricultural and manufacturing products. Dotted across the country-side, you will find rolling hills with forests, large farms, creeks, valleys, and ponds. The state is known as the 'birthplace' of aviation where the first plane was invented by the Wright brothers. Many notable figures of the nations were born and raised in Ohio including 8 US presidents and Niel Armstrong. Ohio is also known as the birthplace of rockin roll</p>
